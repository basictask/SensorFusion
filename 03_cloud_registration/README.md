# Point Cloud Registration
This folder contains a c++ project to register two point clouds. Registration means estimating a rigid transformation that aligns the source cloud with the model cloud.
The repo contains solutions for:
- Nearest Neighbor Search using KD-trees
- Representing rotation using Singular Value Decomposition
- Iterative Closest Point algorithm implementation
- Trimmed Iterative Closest Point algorithm implementation
