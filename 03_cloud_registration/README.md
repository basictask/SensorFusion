# Point Cloud Registration
This folder contains a c++ project to register two point clouds. Registration means estimating a rigid transformation that aligns the source cloud with the model cloud.
The repo contains solutions for:
- Nearest Neighbor Search using KD-trees
- Representing rotation using Singular Value Decomposition
- Iterative Closest Point algorithm implementation
- Trimmed Iterative Closest Point algorithm implementation
The performance of the algorithms was measured using the following metrics:
- Rotation error (angular difference)
- Translation error (euclidean difference)
- SSD 
### Data

### Doc 
Documentation in .pdf format. 
### Plots
All the diagrams for the statistical analysis.
### Results_staged
The matched and merged point clouds for each process and also before the matching process.
### Images
Screenshots of the registeredpoint cloud pairs.
## Main folder
