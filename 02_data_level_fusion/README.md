# Data Level Fusion
The following project's goal is to implement image processing algorithms to filter and upsample disparity images and then reconstruct the 3D scene based on the upsampled disparities. All together 12 pairs of RGB-D images are processed and commpared using different metrics like NCC, SSD/MSE, SSIM.
The following algorithms are implemented:
- Bilateral filtering
- Median bilateral filtering 
- Guided bilateral filtering 
- Naive bilateral upsampling
- Iterative bilateral upsampling
